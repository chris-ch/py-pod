# Proper Orthogonal Decomposition

## Principle
The package contains a processing algorithm for decomposing an input using
a limited number of predefined signals from a bigger set.

Decomposition is performed by iterating projections onto the straight lines
generated by the reference signals.

The proposed algorithm takes a vector space approach. A signal, or more 
precisely its sequence of _N_ temporal samples, is mapped to a point *P* 
in a vector space of dimension _N_. A value taken by a signal *P* at 
sample time _t<sub>i</sub>_ becomes the coordinate of *P* along
the axis _t<sub>i</sub>_.

The set of reference signals represents a library the algorithm micks from
in order to synthetize or approximate any input. The reference points form a 
cloud in the space described above. A linear combination of appropriately 
selected reference points will approximate the target signal *S*.

## Use case: asset replication

The chart below shows the first and final projections in the case of a 3D space:
3 daily performances for a 2 stocks-universe, plus a target fund to replicate.

The first projection is performed on the second stock (yellow), since it better
matches the fund performances than those of the first stock.

The interactive version of the chart above is available 
at [math3d.org](https://www.math3d.org/oXFLiVH54).

Typical sizes for asset replication: 1000 dimensions (~5 years of daily data), 200 candidate assets
for use in replication, target portfolio with 5 assets.
