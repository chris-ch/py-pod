This package implements an algorithm that linearly decomposes the track record of an asset into the performance of several reference factors that best explain its evolution.

A track record is just a sequence of values. Let us define a space where each sample is measured along a different axis, so that for n samples we get a n-dimensional space. In that space a single point represents the historical performances of an asset.

By defining a straight line passing through origin and a reference point we define a subspace generated by the reference point. Any point on that straight line can then be considered as a leveraged version of the reference asset. If a point lies lies beyond the reference asset it has leverage, while between the reference point and the origin then it is under-leveraged. If it lies on the opposite side of the origin it is equivalent as short-selling the asset.

By successively projecting a point onto the closest subspaces we are decomposing a track record into its most relevant components.

The n-dimensiaonl thing may sound scary at first but projecting on a straight line is really straightforward and instantaneous, so even for the biggest practical applications finding a decomposition is just a matter of seconds.
